# About
This is a crowd-funding app in which people fund the owner's smart contract. The smart contract requires a minimum value of 5 ETH, else the donations are rejected. The payment in ETH is denominated in USD  and it's equivalent value is determined at donation time from the Chainlink Price Feed Aggregator. A record of funders with the amount they contributed is kept for recognition or special packages purposes in future.
